Unless it&#39;s her time again or death is going backwards like in the second movie.<br><br>What about the other people that were saved from the premonitions, what about their bloodlines? <br><br>I have so many questions and I hope this movie has some of the answers, I&#39;m so excited.<br><br>I&#39;m glad to see this franchise return and I can&#39;t wait to see Dead Meat&#39;s kill count.",0

2025-03-30T15:06:50Z,@GiaHoaNguyen,"Yup, the movie is repetitive (of course, it scared the heck out of me back in the days). But still, we gotta give the devil his due:<br>1. It has a unique concept: no killer, no ghost, no monster. Just Death, or should I say, a malevolent unseen force known as Death.<br>2. To be quite frank, this franchise doesn&#39;t even need a storyline, or the connection between the installments, at all (luckily, it does). Because this concept can be reused over and over again, as long as the kills are creative (you still have a point, though. Most of the kills are cause by negligence and stupidity). Despite the cliché, they still get me hooked: I&#39;m curious to find out who will go next, and most importantly, HOW.<br><br>Anyway, let&#39;s wait and see what this one has in store.",0

2025-03-29T01:49:26Z,@JaxenRossisback,"I’ve been looking forward to this for the past 14 years. <br><br>First became obsessed with these at a morbidly young age (thank Happy Tree Friends), mostly my fascination with seeing death and destruction in film. Part four is probably my favorite of the bunch for its spectacle (i.e. the race car track and mall premonitions), but I also enjoy parts two and three — I have a soft spot for all the other films but it’s my preference. I remember just before part five was released, I saw a fan-made trailer for it — which predated the film by two years and accurately predicted the bridge collapse sequence! Only in this case did the fan editor combine snippets from earlier horror films to construct a rough trailer (i.e. The Mothman Prophecies, The Omen remake, The Eye and Premonition) – which look so much better than today&#39;s typical digital film processing. As I get older, I can see why I prefer the vintage Y2K-era of films to newer ones. <br><br>I hope they make more of these and come up with even crazier ideas — maybe a ship disaster, a concert venue / football stadium, ski resort, zoo, aquarium or building collapse? (Well, if you factor in this being about first responders, I’ll await to see whatever premonitions they can come up with to put a bang on the screen.) A wise decision to release this theatrically. Maybe they’ll screen the other five movies in a marathon viewing — 4DX per se? I’ll go see them in a heartbeat.<br><br>To Todd, the one and only Bludworth.",1

2025-03-28T20:25:31Z,@schnitzelhorsen1105,"(Extreme 🤓 Warning)<br><br>Final Destination 2 established the rule that if new life is brought into the list, then it stops death&#39;s plans for that list. This grandma supposedly didn&#39;t just have a child, but a whole FAMILY descendant from her. And yet they&#39;re saying that death just...waited 20 years before getting bored and trying to kill them? Who knows how many people from the sky tower were still alive when the grandma had her first child, let alone if any were alive at all. Also, if death really was coming for her, how did she survive for so long? Clear, the longest surviving person on death&#39;s list to ultimately bite the bullet lasted only a few years I think. And that was in pure isolation in a padded room. A rule established in the SECOND movie should not have been forgotten this easily. I would&#39;ve expected the life-stealing rule in the 5th movie or the self-skipping rule in the 4th to be forgotten instead. The filmmakers better have a damn good reason to apply a random exception to this. And also, cheap &quot;remember Terry&#39;s death?&quot; kill.<br><br>TL;DR: this movie&#39;s script violates the second movie&#39;s rule of death.",0

2025-03-28T11:13:34Z,@williameggleton414,"We found out in the previous movie that the crash of Volee Flight 180 may not have even been the start of the whole saga. Perhaps Death may have ALWAYS been around and these disastrous premonitions may have a whole lot more to explain. It seems the tragedy in this film is a collapsing tower, possibly set 40 years before Flight 180 in the 1960s or 70s in Seattle, maybe the Space Needle itself. Maybe the woman&#39;s premonition is what may have triggered Death&#39;s sadistic urge to fulfill its desires. As for what causes the premonitions, it looks like something similar a sixth sense or the Shining from Stephen King. I would love another movie to further explore this disturbing curse through the ages!",0

2025-03-28T02:39:10Z,@xxcagedriotxx,IMO they should have found a way to connect this plot to Clear from 1 &amp; 2 instead of making up a new character who essentially serves the same purpose. Maybe this new direction is geared towards newer audiences who haven&#39;t been watching since the beginning. This is literally the same character but she somehow avoided Death&#39;s wrath for decades with no consequence as opposed to Clear who literally had to choose to admit herself to a mental ward in a straight jacket to avoid any deadly situations....who was very quickly killed upon her return to normal society.,0

It would be better if it were purely imaginative, as horror should be, with the presence of other entities, especially since this film also gives the main character psychic abilities, rather than forcing it like this.<br><br>But they forget that in real life, unwanted things often happen simply due to carelessness, lack of awareness, recklessness, and negligence, leading to negative consequences, whether it&#39;s an accident or something else entirely.<br><br>And it leaves a mark on the audience&#39;s mind, making them paranoid and unconsciously more cautious about everything after watching.<br><br>That is what psychological horror is supposed to be.<br><br>And that&#39;s the core",1

2025-03-27T12:54:32Z,@patrickjordan3051,"If the latest theory—which I firmly believe to be true—that the five main characters in the Final Destination franchise are the cursed descendants of the people Grandma saved from the collapsing tower is accurate, it should rank among the best writing retcons I have ever seen and make perfect sense. But when you take a moment to reflect and realize one thing, it&#39;s completely crazy: if you are cursed by Death in your family tree and you have a premonition of an accident or disaster but save one, two, or more people from it, you have technically &quot;infected&quot; the person you saved to be cursed as well. To put it another way, the &quot;Death curse&quot; is a supernatural virus that, although it is intended to occur when a person dies in a particular accident, does not because of the individual&#39;s premonition; or, in other words, the premonition is a proper antibody. To make matters worse, there is a good chance that someone who has been saved by someone with the &quot;Death curse&quot; may spread it to their friends, family, and other acquaintances too. <br>Holy cow, dude. This is the type of mind-blowing writing Hollywood needs nowadays.",0

2025-03-27T10:41:32Z,@Verasoul,"@TELL5  For the most part, it&#39;s fine. But the first Final Destination had a fantastic ending, but because it didn&#39;t have sequel bait, they fixed their test audience reception to change it. You can&#39;t watch the deleted scenes and original ending as a whole as there was never a director&#39;s cut. They are only rough cuts.<br><br>Same thing happened with Joyride, but worse because they changed the last half of the entire film and that cut is even rougher. Also the only sequel it got was a straight to video b-movie when IPs were being sold off post the 2008 crash.",0

This franchise has legs - just need a good story and unalive some racists, bigots, arrogant people, and other characters that people despise. Most normal movie goers want to see bad people get unalive... of course, many non-bad ones have died too in the franchise which is what makes &quot;death&quot; hated and scary. &quot;Death&quot; is a hero when it unalives the bad people (racists, bigots, arrogance, etc.) but &quot;death&quot; is the villain if it unalives good people (non-racists, non-bigots, innocent, etc.).

My mom and sister wanted me to just snap out of it because they could not understand how i was feeling. Then one day i was alone in my mom&#39;s room laying across my mom bed crying. Then I felt a strong hand on my back holding me down, then I heard a multitude of angels singing the most beautiful song i ever heard before, I knew it was a multitude of angel but they were so nsync with each other that it sounded as if it was one. After that the hand lifted off of me and the depression I had for 2 years was automatically gone.  CALL OUT TO JESUS❤<br>NOT ONLY DOES JESUS SAVES YOUR SOUL, BUT HE FILLS THAT DEEP EMPTY INSIDE THAT YOU HAVE BEEN TRYING YEARS TO SATISFY WITH WORLDY DESIRES, THAT GRATIFIED YOU FOR A WHILE , JUST TO RETURN WITH A VENGEANCE, WHEN JESUS FILLS YOU WILL NEVER AGAIN FILL THAT EMPTINESS.",0

Now with the release of *Final Destination: Bloodlines*, we can&#39;t help but reflect on how this series has shaped who we are. Every terrifying moment taught us something new about life, and our view of the world has been deeply impacted by it. <br><br>We&#39;ve grown up with the <b>relentless dread*, the constant tension of death chasing us around every corner. *Each movie added another layer</b> to our thoughts, helping us understand the delicate balance between luck and fate, and how <b>surviving life</b> isn’t as simple as it seems. For us, the *loyal fans*, it’s not just a trailer, it’s a *reminder of the past*, a call back to those days when we eagerly awaited each new installment, living through unforgettable moments.<br><br><b>Bloodlines</b> isn’t just another chapter in the saga; it’s a <b>deep connection</b> to what we’ve experienced all these years, making us <b>rethink our destiny</b> and the way we view the world around us. The <b>battle with fate</b> is more than just a story, it’s a mirror to our inner selves.<br><br>If you grew up with this series, this trailer isn’t just a watch, it’s <b>part of us, part of our story, and part of a journey that never ends.</b> 🖤🔥 follow my channel for my upcoming video about final destination ❤❤❤❤❤❤❤",1

Obviously most of us that when saw &quot;dead runs in the family&quot; at the end of the &quot;teaser trailer&quot;... we all thought that it was about a connection to one of the characters from one of the previous movies, but in here it&#39;s revealed that we were so very straight wrong; and thinking of something...... since it&#39;s not even a connection......... then they should make a &quot;short film&quot; of the revelation shown at &quot;<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UWMzKXsY9A4&amp;t=73"">1:13</a>&quot; cuz a flashback scene is more than pure damned nonsense.",0

2025-03-27T00:10:24Z,@tgfvfrd34tfrey,"The British Medical Journal (BMJ): Cheng Peiming Detained Multiple Times for Practicing Falun Gong<br>BMJ reported on August 12, 2024 that a man spoke at an event in Washington, D.C., about how he was detained, tortured, and forced to undergo surgery in China.<br><br>The report reads, “Cheng Pei Ming, described as the ‘first known survivor’ of China’s forced organ harvesting campaign against prisoners, said that he was detained several times between 1999 and 2004 for being a practitioner of Falun Gong.<br><br>“After being sentenced to eight years in prison in 2002, Cheng said that he was tortured, and in 2004 forcibly taken to a hospital and pressured to sign consent forms for an operation after swallowing sharp objects. Despite refusing to sign, Cheng said that he was held down by guards and injected with anesthetics.”<br><br>The US PubMed also posted the URL link of the article titled “‘Tortured, drugged, and assaulted’: Chinese survivor of forced organ harvesting speaks out.”<br><br>The Irish Sun: Pure Evil<br>The Irish Sun carried a report on August 9, 2024 titled “PURE EVIL I had my organs harvested by China’s ‘Gestapo’ who carved up my lung &amp; liver, says first known survivor of sick torture.”<br><br>“Cheng Pei Ming says he endured years of prison torture for practising the Falun Gong religion against the will of the Chinese Communist Party.”<br><br>The report continued, “In 2002, Cheng was imprisoned for eight years after advocating for an end to the persecution of Falun Gong by the government.<br><br>“He said one day he was taken to a hospital against his will.”<br><br>He added, “They tried to force me to sign consent forms for an operation.<br><br>“When I refused, six guards grabbed me and held me down and I was injected with something.<br><br>“The next thing I remember is being in a hospital bed with tubes in my nose and I was going in and out of consciousness.<br><br>“There was a tube with bloody liquid coming from under the bandaging that was on my side.”<br><br>The report referred to Professor Wendy Rogers, chair of International Coalition to End Transplant Abuse in China, who said, “I do not know why the Chinese doctors removed parts of Mr. Cheng’s liver and lungs, but I do know that he did not have a disease or illness requiring this surgery.<br><br>“The portion of liver removed is consistent with securing liver tissue suitable for transplantation into a child, but I have no means of knowing if this was the purpose.<br><br>“What I do know is that Mr. Cheng was surgically assaulted as part of a wider pattern of persecution, incarceration and torture, and that these events happened to him because he is a practitioner of Falun Gong.”",0

It has no connection cause they show a book of how it starts. You sound like a goofy a person who never wrote anything and you all over me because you know I’m right but I’m outside you the type that. You never made a trailer so you sound like a person only focused on being entertained like the good consumer you are. Be that and get off my D,0

Like, it&#39;s going to explain that everyone from the previous Final Destination movies are descendants of the Space Needle accident, and we&#39;re now going to focus on this particular family now. <br><br>To me, this also sounds like we could set up more prequels to this movie. How will death take people in complicated ways in the 1900s or even in the Industrial Revolution? Maybe death was  setting up a chain of events that caused Mrs. O&#39;Leary&#39;s cow to knock over a lantern and start the great Chicago fire.",0

2025-03-26T20:07:41Z,@leonavu,"Man, to see Tony Todd so frail is not easy. I lived in LA for 6 months in the late 90s and saw him at a party once. Dude was so physically imposing that it was scary, but i heard him chatting with someone and even with that voice of his, he was kind and respectful. I remember first seeing him in the remake of Night of the Living Dead, and will always remember him mowing down zombies one after another. The Crow, Star Trek Next Gen and DS9, The Rock, and of course the Candyman movies. But my favorite performance of his was in The Man From Earth, a movie about an immortal man who reveals himself to the friends he made over the last 20 years on the night he is going to move on to his next life. Tony Todd is great - the whole cast is, actually, and it is a fantastic script. And his voice work is stellar, of course.<br><br>You are missed, big man. RIP.",6

Interesting and a real new concept for the franchise.

The 5th one kinda but the 3rd and 4th were to cheesy. This one gets me though,0

Literally no one in my school has ever even heard about the series at all. (I’m in 7th grade as of right now) This is one of if not the most underrated horror series I’ve ever watched. (It’s even better when you understand how it works),260

Not to mention, it’s also very interesting on how the directors got the job to direct this movie. They faked their death on an interviews when they were looking for directors.

How do you also go to a Chinese pin treatment thing with a giant head statue on top your shelf in reaching distance for the customer.

2025-03-26T02:58:23Z,@anthonycarr6732,"Unfortunately, I have to deal with “Final Destination” feelings everyday. I survived a plane crash at Richmond International Airport in Richmond, VA on April 11, 2011 due to catastrophic left engine failure of my aircraft immediately after takeoff. I suffered 65% burns, 68 total surgeries (so far), 2 amputated fingers on my right hand, a completely rebuilt nose, and hundreds upon hundreds of hours of physical, occupational, and psychological therapy. There are risks to everything we do in life, and some things are simply out of our control. I suffer with PTSD and am often hyper aware, knowing something is going to happen but not the what, when, or where. It’s a terrible feeling that never subsides and is a true nightmare to experience. I truly mean this when I say live each day to the fullest, tell your loved ones how much you love them, and be grateful for everything you have. I received a 2nd chance at life, and I’m thankful for that every single day.",85

2025-03-25T23:20:43Z,@KazeriantheVIIII,RIP Tony Todd.  One of my favorite actors.  He was a regular guest star on Star Trek.  His role as Worf&#39;s brother Kurn is one of the best in Star Trek.  One thing about Tony Todd whenever he came on the screen he totally dominated and commanded the scene.  There were scenes he took charge of and upstaged the regular stars of the show.  A few producers once said that if we needed a ratings boost lets get Tony Todd.  Its no coincidence that some of the highest rated Star Trek episodes featured Tony Todd.  Looking forward to seeing this movie.,0

2025-03-25T21:40:07Z,@ryanbehon4001,"So basically what I gather (just my theory) is that all the movies may be connected by this <b>first</b> premonition. It would make sense because she mentions that she saved a lot of lives that weren’t meant to be saved. So if those many survivors had children later on, who had more children, and they were never meant to exist at all, it could be why Death comes after seemingly random groups of people in each movie. One of those people just happens to have a heightened 6th sense to have a glimpse into the design. They’re all connected by this main event and may not have ever known it. It’s a crazy way of tying everything together, and if that’s what it is then it’s incredibly well written 🙌🏻",0

2025-03-25T21:38:07Z,@Official_Blank01,So I have a theory now what if this event that the grandma saved all of those peoples lives what if those people who survived go on to be the people on the prior films and are the family members of the survivors so death has to pick off each family member and person in those moves finally reaching the people in this family but idk this is just my theory I have,0

2025-03-25T21:02:56Z,@JoaoVitorSilva-r6h,"“Only by embracing Death, it will pass you by” that line is very interesting cause in the old movies people died cause death was coming for the and they tried to avoid it, but what if you embrace the Death as a natural part of life, like does it mean your not getting killed for accepting that Death is part of everybody life and everybody goes through it, it just seems very interesting idea and I wonder what they are gonna do with this movie about it.",0

If they’re backyard was even 50% more organized, wasn’t in such DISREPAIR (trampoline), and things where put where they belonged and with the most basic level of being securely fastened, they wouldn’t be in any danger.<br><br>I mean, it’s scary if this is saying Death is legitimately influencing their actions of the people to act and behave like they do, but they way he slams the beer bottle thinking it’s safe is just an individual choice. I personally would think I’ll put it further away from the edge, or somewhere less precarious. It must be because they don’t have the benefit of watching these movies, but my god who leaves a sharpened rake under a trampoline? Who doesn’t notice a giant package car? That one annoyed me. It’s not final destination, it’s Darwin at work if you stand in the street. Say what you will about cars being a plague? But I learned very very early the world we live in means cars drive on the street and they can kill you. I learned slightly later just how mindless people who “drive” these things actually are.

It&#39;s really sad to see the speed Tony Todd&#39;s last performance, but I&#39;m ecstatic that he&#39;s going to be in it nonetheless. I want to give a early prediction. Anybody leave me a thought your thoughts. If you agree or disagree, I&#39;d like to think this is going to be a misdirect type of movie. So when you saw the character complaining saying oh this isn&#39;t really happening and the trailer cuts before we see a bus possibly hit him. I think they&#39;re playing with us on that one. There&#39;s no way they&#39;re going to do a bus track again. It&#39;s been done too many times. They got to be playing a mistract that way that character can go on saying see nothing&#39;s really going to happen🎉🎉🎉",0

Now six is expanding it more by exploring the descendants of a survivor which is such a good sign this will be good❤❤❤❤❤❤❤,208

2025-03-25T19:32:11Z,@alchriss.8998,"I think a final Final Destination movie that connects everything would be a perfect way to conclude the series. The franchise has always had a loose connection through William Bludworth and Death’s rules, but an installment that fully ties together every disaster, survivor, and event would make it feel like one big, horrifying puzzle finally being solved.<br><br>Here’s what I’d love to see:<br><br>-A reveal that the 1960s tower fire survivors were the ancestors of the previous films&#39; survivors, making all the disasters part of one long, generational curse.<br><br>-William Bludworth’s true role finally explained—is he just an observer, or does he know a way to break Death’s cycle? Maybe he was connected to Esther and the original survivors.<br><br>-A final group of survivors from past movies coming together, realizing they were never just random victims—they were all part of a bigger, predestined event leading to one ultimate confrontation with Death.<br><br>-A shocking, mind-blowing ending—either they finally find a way to break Death’s cycle, or there’s a dark twist that shows it was all inevitable from the start.<br><br>If Bloodlines is setting this up, it could be the franchise’s way of leading into a huge, epic conclusion. I really hope the filmmakers take the opportunity to give fans something more than just another standalone entry. A true final chapter that brings everything full circle would be legendary.",61

We know death doesnt like to be cheated or his plans messed up so he always comes to collect. But what keeps causing the glitch in the first place? Is it secretly death just having fun by playing with his toys? Is it another entity trying to spare people? I don’t need a whole movie about it but I think it would be a nice little addition to the lore if we expanded on that aspect,0

I know people are speaking on his appearance, but he chose to come back for this despite his health and I think that speaks volumes on who he was.

IF glass broke you would stop at all cost to make sure all the glass was gone. Seriously count all the Hazards in this Yard. One thing I will always liked about the Scream movies. They aimed to give people some kind of self aware and common sense. Yes it entertainment, but come on. Give your cast some type brains in these movies. Instead of making people so damn stupid to sell a movie. I love a good Horror Movie, but can&#39;t stand that most Horror movies have to make people stupid on purpose.<br>RIP Tony Todd",0

Now six is expanding it more by exploring the descendants of a survivor which is such a good sign this will be good,28

2025-03-25T20:20:00Z,@V00doo1Xim,@@syazwanroslee657 I believe that she would get kicked out for making a scene by warning the guests in time for the collapse to happen. She avoided Death several times and started a family and Death is resorting to killing her family one by one because they wouldn’t have existed if she died in the sky tower collapse.,0
2025-03-30T04:23:23Z,@CrisisHedgehog,"@@V00doo1Xim considering the fact that she said that she saved lives during that day I could only assume that people followed her out of there. Death kills in the same order that people died in the premonition; it definitely looks like more than 30 to 50 people are involved… the deaths don’t come too fast either so if I’m right, it already would take a long time for death to come back to her since usually the person who has the premonition is the one who dies last…",0

2025-03-25T15:19:32Z,@adrenolife1460,I gotta hand it to the cinematography in this one. Its actually creating a sense of paranoia and threat with all the close ups and greatly timed angles. Especially in the teaser clip when the chain rattling sound was increased and slowed to increase tension. Previous movies had some level of the same cinematography but many a times they were hit or miss.<br><br> What I didn&#39;t like was they basically spoiled the main plot in the damn trailer. I was looking forward to know how it all started in this but they just revealed it like nothing and the plot that the movie will revolve around her family dying. Atleast the famous &quot;explainer&quot; is in the movie hehe,10
